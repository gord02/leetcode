// More precisely actually, it's that we will look at each number at most 
twice(calculate the conditions), but swap once. Consider, you swap 
cur_index with some index behind, in that case, you will need to look at 
again, but never swap it again.
    
// We visit each number once, and each number will be put in its right
    place at most once, so it is O(n) + O(n).
